# YouTube Blocker

Damn you YouTube for constantly baiting me into watching more videos! ðŸ˜¡

I am putting an end to this in the form of a chrome extension.

This timer allocates 60 minutes a day of videos. The timer counts down to video playback time, not time on site. So if you pause the video the timer pauses. Nifty, Eh?

### Future development

- [ ] Configurable the daily time allotment.
- [ ] Create a setup guide
- [ ] Sync multiple browser tabs â€”Â Currently you can cheat the system by having multiple videos open. This hasn't been a critical problem for myself, but I would like to fix it.
- [ ] "Educational use" mode â€” One of my favorite features about YouTube is the wealth of information. There a tons of valuable talks that may be over 60-minutes. So, I'm playing around with the idea of adding an "educational use" overwrite.
